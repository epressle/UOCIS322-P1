# UOCIS322 - Project 1 - Ethan Pressley, epressle@uoregon.edu #

A basic web server written in Python that checks and returns different statuses based on file name.

### What is this repository for? ###

The objectives of this mini-project are:

  * Experience with GIT workflow with separate configuration:
  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;
  turn in configuration file with reference to repo.
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of
  basic web architecture
  * Use automated tests to check progress (plus manual tests for good measure)

### What do I need?  Where will it work? ###

* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged),
therefore using a port number above 1000.

### Running ###

* With a valid credentials.ini in the root folder, 'make run' should run the webserver.
* 'make start' and 'make stop' should work as well.
